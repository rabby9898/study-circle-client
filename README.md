# Project Features

This section provides an overview of the key features and functionality of the project.

## React Router Setup

- The project incorporates React Router for efficient navigation and routing between various pages within the application.

## Private Route

- Private routes are implemented to secure specific pages that necessitate user authentication. These protected pages include "My Assignment," "Submitted Assignment," "Assignment Details," and "Update Assignment."

## Main Layout

- A unified main layout component, "MainLayOut," ensures a consistent and cohesive user experience throughout the application.

## Dynamic URL Routes

- The routing system supports dynamic URL parameters for the "Assignment Details" and "Update Assignment" pages. These dynamic parameters facilitate the retrieval of assignment-specific data from the server, resulting in a personalized user experience.

## API Data Loading

- Data for particular routes is fetched from a server using the `fetch` function. For instance, the "All Assignment" page fetches assignment data from the server, guaranteeing that users have access to the most up-to-date information.

## Multiple Pages

- The application features a variety of pages, each designed to fulfill a distinct purpose:
  - "Home"
  - "Login"
  - "Register"
  - "Create Assignment"
  - "All Assignment"
  - "My Assignment"
  - "Submitted Assignment"
  - "Assignment Details"
  - "Update Assignment"

Collectively, these features establish an organized and feature-rich environment for effortless navigation and interaction within the application. Users can seamlessly manage assignments and access vital information.
